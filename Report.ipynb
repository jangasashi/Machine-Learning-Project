    "- **age**: Age of the patient\n",
    "- **sex**: Gender (0 = female, 1 = male)\n",
    "- **chest pain type**: Type of chest pain (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic)\n",
    "- **resting blood pressure**: Blood pressure when at rest\n",
    "- **serum cholesterol**: Cholesterol level\n",
    "- **fasting blood sugar**: Blood sugar level (1 = sugar > 120mg/dL, 0 = sugar < 120mg/dL)\n",
    "- **resting electrocardiogram**: ECG result (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal, 2 = left ventricular hypertrophy)\n",
    "- **maximum heart rate**: Highest heart rate during exercise\n",
    "- **exercise-induced angina**: Whether the patient experiences chest pain during exercise (0 = no, 1 = yes)\n",
    "- **oldpeak**: Depression caused by exercise\n",
    "- **ST slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upward, 2 = flat, 3 = downward)\n",

    "This project successfully built a heart disease prediction system. The Random Forest model performed well with an accuracy of 95%. Key features such as chest pain type, exercise-induced angina, and ST slope were found to be important indicators of heart disease. The model can be used to assist in early heart disease detection.\n",
